## Common Patterns That Work

### Opening Hook Patterns

1. **Acknowledgment + Insight:** "[Achievement] - [what this says about them/their company]"
2. **Observation + Difficulty:** "[What they did] - [acknowledgment of how hard this is]"
3. **Milestone + Context:** "[Event] - [bigger picture significance]"

### Bridge Patterns

1. **Stage-based:** "Companies at this stage often..."
2. **Type-based:** "Leaders who [trait] usually..."
3. **Pattern recognition:** "In our experience, [similar situation] companies find..."

### What Makes These Work

- **Specific details** show you did homework
- **Recent information** shows you're paying attention
- **Natural progression** from hook to business value
- **Peer-to-peer tone** positions you as an equal
- **Soft connection** doesn't force the transition

## Anti-Examples (What NOT to Do)

### Bad Subject Lines
- ❌ "Quick question" (generic)
- ❌ "Following up" (assumes prior contact)
- ❌ "Partnership opportunity" (salesy)

### Bad Opening Hooks
- ❌ "I see you're in the financial services industry" (too generic)
- ❌ "I've been following your company for years" (sounds stalkerish)
- ❌ "Hope you're having a great day" (waste of words)

### Bad Bridges
- ❌ "I'd love to tell you about our solution" (make it about them)
- ❌ "Our company is the leading provider of..." (who cares?)
- ❌ "I know you're busy, but..." (then don't waste their time)

## Hook Quality Scale

**Level 5 (Excellent):** Recent personal achievement with business relevance
*"Your TEDx talk on leadership last month"*

**Level 4 (Very Good):** Recent company milestone with specific detail
*"The Sydney office opening marks 5 locations across Australia"*

**Level 3 (Good):** Industry recognition or award
*"Congrats on the Fast 100 listing"*

**Level 2 (Acceptable):** Company anniversary or round number
*"15 years in business this year"*

**Level 1 (Weak):** Generic industry observation
*"I see you're in the manufacturing space"*

## Adaptation Examples

### Same Hook, Different Industries

**Research:** CEO completed charity bike ride

**For Software Company:**
"Your 500km charity ride shows the kind of persistence that builds great software companies."

**For Manufacturing Company:**
"Your 500km charity ride shows the kind of endurance needed in manufacturing leadership."

**For Consulting Firm:**
"Your 500km charity ride demonstrates the discipline your clients probably see in your strategic work."

### Same Company, Different Hooks

**TechCorp Options:**

**Hook 1 (Funding):** "Series B secured - scaling challenges ahead"
**Hook 2 (Team):** "From 50 to 200 employees in 18 months"
**Hook 3 (Product):** "The new AI feature is getting attention"
**Hook 4 (Leadership):** "Your post about remote team culture resonated"

Choose based on recency and relevance to your solution.

*Remember: One good hook is better than three weak ones. Pick the strongest and build from there.*
