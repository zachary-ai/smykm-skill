# SMYKM (Show Me You Know Me) Sales Skill

A systematic framework for crafting personalised B2B outreach that gets responses. Transform cold outreach from generic spam to compelling, research-driven messages.

## What This Skill Does

**SMYKM** (Show Me You Know Me) is a research-driven methodology that helps you craft personalised subject lines and opening hooks for B2B outreach. Instead of generic "hope this finds you well" emails, you'll create messages that demonstrate genuine familiarity with your prospect.

**Expected Results:**
- 15-25% response rate (vs 1-3% for generic outreach)
- 50-70% open rate
- Professional, peer-to-peer positioning

**Time Investment:** 5-10 minutes per prospect

## What You Get

This framework provides:
1. **5-minute research process** - systematic approach to finding compelling hooks
2. **Subject line formulas** - 5 proven templates for different scenarios
3. **Opening hook templates** - personalised first sentences that work
4. **Bridge statements** - connect any hook to any value proposition
5. **Quality checklist** - ensure professional results every time

## How It Works

### Step 1: Research (5 minutes)
- LinkedIn recent activity
- Company milestones
- Personal achievements
- Industry context

### Step 2: Subject Line
Choose from 5 proven formulas:
- Achievement Recognition: "50 years - impressive milestone"
- Curiosity Question: "Berlin expansion next?"
- Personal + Professional: "Marathon runner AND CEO"
- Company + Context: "TechCo's rapid expansion"
- Specific Callout: "Your LinkedIn post on resilience"

### Step 3: Opening Hook
Match your research to proven templates:
- Milestone Hook: "Noticed [Company] just celebrated [milestone]..."
- Achievement Hook: "[Specific achievement] - [acknowledgment]..."
- News Hook: "Saw the news about [event] - [insight]..."
- Personal Hook: "[Interest] + [business connection] = [observation]..."

### Step 4: Bridge to Value
Universal connectors that work with any solution:
- "That's exactly the kind of [challenge/opportunity] where we help..."
- "Companies at this stage often tell us..."
- "This kind of [growth/change] is where..."

## Who This Is For

- **Sales professionals** doing B2B outreach
- **Founders** reaching out to prospects
- **Business developers** building relationships
- **Anyone** who wants higher response rates on cold outreach

## Example in Action

**Subject:** "Marathon discipline"
**Opening:** "Your Melbourne Marathon finish is impressive - that kind of discipline clearly extends to how you've built TechCo."
**Bridge:** "Companies scaling at this pace often tell us..."
[Your value proposition]
